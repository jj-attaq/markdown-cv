Current project
I am currently working on a Telegram chatbot that will notify me when and where there will be Salsa and Bachata parties in Belgrade. The bot will be built using the Telegram bot API and Apify’s Instagram post scraper API.
Previous project
I built a todo application built with Go, SQL, and the GORM ORM, assisted by Postman, and TablePlus. The application started simply, and grew into a much more complex project as I added functionality. The implementation of cookies was particularly interesting, though I found the task of organizing the code and connecting all the moving parts to be the most instructive part of the project. The code can be found here: github.com/jj-attaq/todo/tree/new-todo-api.
Proficient in
Go, Javascript, Python, Vim (Neovim), Markdown, SQL, Postman, the JQ json processor.
Fluent in
English, French and Serbian.
Research interests
I am currently deepening my knowledge of Go and trying write it in a more idiomatic way. I am also learning how to use and implement various algorithms and data structures, such as binary search, quick sort, as well as stacks, queues and binary search trees. I would also like to tackle learning C in the future so I can better understand memory management.
