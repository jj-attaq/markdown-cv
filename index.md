## Current Project
I am currently working on a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chatbot that will notify me when and where there will be Salsa and Bachata parties in Belgrade. The bot will be built using the [Telegram bot API](https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api) and Apifyâ€™s [Instagram post scraper API](https://apify.com/apify/instagram-post-scraper) post scraper API.
<!-- I am currently working on a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chatbot that will notify me when and where there will be Salsa and Bachata parties in Belgrade. The bot will be built using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to scrape [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/) instead of relying on [Apify](https://apify.com/apify/instagram-post-scraper) as was done in the prototype, the scraper will be written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the rest in [Go](go.dev). My previous prototype is available here [https://github.com/jj-attaq/party-bot](https://github.com/jj-attaq/party-bot). -->

## Previous Project
I built a todo application built with Go, SQL, and the GORM ORM, assisted by Postman, and TablePlus. The application started simply, and grew into a much more complex project as I added functionality. The implementation of cookies was particularly interesting, though I found the task of organizing the code and connecting all the moving parts to be the most instructive part of the project. The code can be found here: [github.com/jj-attaq/todo/tree/new-todo-api](github.com/jj-attaq/todo/tree/new-todo-api).

### Proficient in
Go, Javascript, Python, Vim (Neovim), Markdown, SQL, Postman.

### Fluent in
English, French and Serbian.


### Research interests
I am currently deepening my knowledge of Go and trying write it in a more idiomatic way. I am also learning how to use and implement various algorithms and data structures, such as binary search, quick sort, as well as stacks, queues and binary search trees. I plan on learning Lua so that I can better understand and customize my Neovim configuration. I would also like to tackle learning C in the future so I can better understand memory management.
